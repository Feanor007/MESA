MESA is a tool for decoding cellular neighborhoods in spatial omics data. It incorporates a multiomics strategy by integrating single-cell modalities with spatial omics data in silico, thus layering on additional dimensions of information, to facilitate a deeper understanding of cellular neighborhoods and their spatial interactions within tissue microenvironments. It also employs a multi-scale diversity index, along with global and local diversity indices, to systematically quantify cellular diversity and identify diversity hotspots.

## Installation

MESA is hosted on `pypi` and can be installed via `pip`. 

```
pip install mesa
```
