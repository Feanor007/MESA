MESA - Multiomics and Ecological Spatial Analysis in Python
===========================================================

**MESA** is a tool for decoding cellular neighborhoods in spatial omics data.
MESA is a tool for decoding cellular neighbourhoods in spatial omics data. It incorporates a multiomics strategy by integrating single-cell modalities with spatial omics data in silico, thus layering on additional dimensions of information, to facilitate a deeper understanding of cellular neighbourhoods and their spatial interactions within tissue microenvironments. It also employs a multi-scale diversity index (MDI), along with global/local diversity index (GDI & LDI) and Diversity Proximity Index (DPI), to systematically quantify cellular diversity and identify diversity hot/coldspots.
