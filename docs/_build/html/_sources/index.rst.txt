MESA - Multiomics and Ecological Spatial Analysis in Python
===========================================================

**MESA** is a tool for decoding cellular neighborhoods in spatial omics data.
It employs a multi-scale diversity index, along with global and local diversity indices, to systematically quantify cellular diversity and identify diversity hotspots. It also incorporates a multiomics strategy by integrating single-cell modalities with spatial omics data in silico, thus layering on additional dimensions of information, to facilitate a deeper understanding of cellular neighborhoods and their spatial interactions within tissue microenvironments.
